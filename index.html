          <p>
            This short course gives an introductory look at the basics of web
            development. It is ideal for anyone interested in seeing if web
            development is for them and wants to understand their options in the
            field without breaking the bank. Intro to Web is the starting point to
            many of our longer specialised courses. The course is centred around a
            practical project of building a digital resumé using HTML and CSS.
